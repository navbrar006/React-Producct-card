Product Card Component – React Props Demo

This project focuses on building a reusable ProductCard component using React. The main objective is to understand component-based architecture and data flow using props. Each product card displays essential product information such as image, name, price, and stock status.

The component is designed to be dynamic and reusable, allowing different product data to be passed through props without modifying the component logic. Conditional rendering is used to visually represent the stock status (In Stock / Out of Stock), improving user experience.

Modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and card-based layouts are applied to ensure a clean and responsive UI across devices. The project demonstrates how React components can be reused multiple times with different data, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

Overall, this experiment helps learners understand props, conditional rendering, and responsive UI design in React through a simple and practical example.
